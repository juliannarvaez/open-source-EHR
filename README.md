# open-source-EHR

Electronic health record (EHR) systems present a unique opportunity for low-resource health systems in developing nations. Tracking disease incidence, standardizing medical inventory procurement chains, and maintaining continuous patient records can be achieved with a robust EHR system implementation across clinics. However, EHR system implementation can be expensive. Estimates of the upfront cost for EHR implementation range anywhere from $15,000 - $75,000 ([https://www.healthit.gov/faq/how-much-going-cost-me](https://www.healthit.gov/faq/how-much-going-cost-me)) for EHR software and IT support. Open source software is available to minimize the financial burden of EHR software; [GNU Health](https://www.gnuhealth.org) offers a free, open-source EHR software that fulfills the need for an inexpensive and comprehensive EHR system.

GNU Health EHR system deployment can be achieved using low-cost single board computers such as a Raspberry Pi. Limited instructions are available regarding Raspberry Pi installation on the [GNU Health website] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_Health/Embedded). This repository has been created to offer a more set of installation instructions for the GNU Health EHR system on a Raspberry Pi.
